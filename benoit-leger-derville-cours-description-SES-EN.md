# Secure Electronic Signature / Secure Digital Signature 

### Managing Instructor :	 Benoit LEGER-DERVILLE 

## Objectives, Course or academic activity summary
This course is about understanding the difficulties inherent in the implementation of electronic (or digital) signature in real large-scale projects.

One of the main purpose is to make students aware about the complexity of organizational, legal and cultural aspects of effective digital signature implementation, despite its theoretical security level (cryptography).

Initially and after a few cryptographic reminders, the goal as well as technical and organizational principles of the digital signature are presented to the students. Then is exposed the body of rules leading to the secure digital signature in there detailing all organizational (PKI authority, certification practice statement and provider certification) and technical aspects (HSM, SSCD, international standards, signature verification application, RGS, others).

The practical benefits offered to students are the understanding of the complex and vulnerable set of works (practical work), the use of a rich but but unfamiliar body of standards, the synthesis of the main legal texts and especially the awareness of widespread ignorance of what represents the interests of the digital signature within companies themselves.
